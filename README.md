# BubbleBall
  Aim of the game is to beat the other team by scoring as many goals as possible.
  
  **Current Progress** : 
  - Able to use pass or pass-through to the other players on your team (it passes to the nearest player on your team).
  - able to shoot (the player will shoot the ball at the opponents goal for you).

  **Bugs so far** :
  - User still in control of player after pass: https://github.com/SteveParker-github/BubbleBall/issues/2
